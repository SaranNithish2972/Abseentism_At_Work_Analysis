# Abseentism at work 
This is an Analysis done on Abseentism at work place. A dataset with 100 rows and 13 columns is selected. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on the data and visualized using various graphs. As this is a classification problem (Abseentism 1 , No Abseentism 0) we use supervised algorithms such as <b> Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) </b>. In which <b>Random Forest Classifier</b> gives the more accuracy.
